            Currently, 80% of our natural fibres are organic or Oekotex certified. As we grow, we aim to make 100%
            of our natural fibres organic or sustainable within the next few years. Also, we are moving towards using
            recycled materials when it is cost-effective and possible.

            At present 80% of our factory structure is GOTS or OEKOTEX certified. <br>We aim to convert 100% of our

            It is well known that fashion is a polluting industry. Despite this, Cerulean believes that every little
            step will contribute to reducing waste and pollution in the communities in which we operate.

            Reducing our carbon footprint

          <p class="mt-5">
            We are moving towards working with factories that reduce, reuse, and recycle and also are striving to be a
            zero-waste organization.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-5">
            Like in any industry transport has a huge carbon footprint. We aim to reduce that by using the least
            polluting transport options available and eventually stop using air freight completely which has a huge
            negative impact on our planet.

            Being in Europe we want to support the European fashion supply chain. We have been using
            European Linen (certified and traceable European Flax) for over 5 years now for our customers.

          <p class="mt-5">
            We are also researching actively to reduce or use packaging which is either recycled or sustainable and use
            as little plastic as possible. The fashion industry generates a huge amount of plastic and other packaging
            waste. We are slowly moving towards using compostable plastic bags and using plastic-free carton tapes.

            Opaque was so 20th century. Cerulean intends to be completely transparent in our supply chain.<br> We ensure
            our factory structure is above board, known to our customers.<br> What goes inside each product and who
            makes the products is very important.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-5">
            We have processes in place to ensure each of these actors are identified, certified, and audited to ensure
            the highest standards of safety and compliance.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-10">
            One of our key axes is to provide employment in India.<br> We work hard to increase our business not just
            for profits but also to have a positive impact on our society as a whole.<br> Indirectly Cerulean supports
            the employment of close to 1000 people – so if we calculate the human cost of a lost order, it directly
            translates to lost wages for a factory worker and his/her family.

          <p class="mt-10">
            This journey has just begun, there are many more social and environmental initiatives we are embarking
            on....so watch this space for more to come...
